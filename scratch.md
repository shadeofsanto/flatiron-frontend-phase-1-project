//Hitting "/" on keyboard will turn on/off certain console msgs - stops people from seeing being able to read the console log to see the answers
//I did not think about it until now, but this is an obsolete eventlistener because I made it stop sending the answers in the console log itself, but I still thought this was cool so I am leaving it in. - taking them out to reduce the needless lines of code but wanted this stored for future use on other projects I might make.
// document.addEventListener('keypress', (event) =>{
// let keyCode = event.key;
      
// if(keyCode == "/" || keyCode == "/"){
//   if (dbug){
//       dbug = false;
//       console.log(`dbug = ${dbug}`);
//     }
//   else{
//       dbug=true;
//       console.log(`dbug = ${dbug}`);
//     }
//   }
// });
